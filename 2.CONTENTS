This github repository contains two simulations of astrophysics.

One of them is the accretion disc that is formed around black holes at galactic centers.The simulation aims to find the stable radial distribution of the different parameters of the accretion disc.It utilises the finite difference scheme.

The second one simulates molecular cloud collapse using SPH.

The third one computes graviational forces for N-body problem based on a hierarchial approach.
